# R-KaggleSurvey
Discover the toop tools kaggle participants use for data science and machine learning


**Introduction** </br>
Throughout data science, many languages and tools can be used to complete a given task. While you can often use whichever tool you prefer, it is usually crucial for analysts to work with similar platforms to share their code with one another. Learning what professionals in the data science industry use while at work can help you better understand things you may be asked to do in the future. In this project, we will find out what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. Our data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey, which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyze data in their daily work.

**Conclusion** </br>
We've found that Python is the most popular language used among Kaggle data scientists, but R users aren't far behind. And while Python users may highly recommend that new learners learn Python.
